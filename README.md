# Oil-Spill-Simulation-With-Regression
Simulation of Oil Spill in sea waters using CoppeliaSIm and prediction of contaminated water using linear regression

## 0. Read the problem statement "Projeto-Final.pdf"
## 1. Setup CoppeliaSim RemoteAPI
## 2. Run the coppeliacode.py script
## 3. Enjoy the ans.png with the representation of the mass centers and ellipses of th oil spill
## 4. Enjoy the modelo.txt with the coeffients of the Linear regression model to predict Affected Area
